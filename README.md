# 📁 File Type Inspector (Linux Learning Project)

This is a simple beginner-friendly project that simulates the Linux `file` command using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**.

In Linux, when you run:
$ file photo.png

The system tells you the type of file.

This project does the same thing inside a browser.  
You upload a file → the page tells you its **name**, **type**, and **size**, just like Linux.

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

I am learning Linux and documenting each command by building a small project around it.  
This project is for the **file** command.

The goal is to:

- Understand how the `file` command works  
- Practice working with files in JavaScript  
- Create something interactive that looks like a terminal  
- Add it to my GitHub Linux learning journey

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **HTML** → for the file input  
- **CSS** → for the terminal look  
- **JavaScript** → for detecting the file type and size  

---

## 🚀 How It Works

1. You select a file using the upload button  
2. JavaScript reads the file information  
3. The page prints output that looks like Linux:

Example:
$ file example.png
example.png: image/png, 20394 bytes

## 🔗 Part of My Linux Journey

This project is one part of my **Linux Learning Series**, where I recreate Linux commands as web apps to understand them better.

More projects coming soon!
